Change inline styling of an element using the style object
Modify attributes using getAttribute and setAttribute
Traverse, create, append and remove elements from the DOM
Recap
So far you’ve seen how to select elements in the DOM using the following methods

querySelector
querySelectorAll
getElementById
getElementsByClassName
getElementsByTagName
Now that you’ve learned how to select elements in the DOM, let’s see how we can modify their values and attributes!

Modifying Elements in the DOM
Accessing text
The easiest way to access the text of an element is to use innerText

<section id="main-greeting">
  <article>Hello World!</article>
</section>
const mainGreeting = document.getElementById("main-greeting")

console.log(mainGreeting.innerText) // "Hello World!"
Modifying text
If you need to change any text, you can assign a new value to the innerHTML:

<section id="main-greeting">
  <article>Hello World!</article>
</section>
const mainGreeting = document.getElementById("main-greeting")

mainGreeting.innerText = "It's changed!"
Using textContent
Another common way to access and modify text is to use the textContent property

<section id="main-greeting">
  <article>Hello World!</article>
</section>
const mainGreeting = document.getElementById("main-greeting")

mainGreeting.textContent = "It's changed!"
So what’s the difference?
There are quite a few small differences:

innerText is aware of the rendered appearance of text, while textContent is not.
textContent gets the content of all elements, including <script> and <style> elements. In contrast, innerText only shows “human-readable” elements.
depending on the complexity of the content inside an element, innerText can be a bit less performant that textContent
for now, you can use either, but be aware that both exist!
Accessing HTML
If you need to access the HTML of an element, you can use innerHTML. This will include all the elements inside of the one you select.

<section id="main-greeting">
  <article>Hello World!</article>
</section>
You will find yourself using innerText more commonly, there are some security concerns when using innerHTML if you’re not careful.

Modifying HTML
If you need to change any HTML, you can assign a new value to the innerHTML:

<section id="main-greeting">
  <article>Hello World!</article>
</section>
const mainGreeting = document.getElementById("main-greeting")

mainGreeting.innerHTML = "<article>Just Changed!</article>"
Another reason it’s less common to use innerHTML is that you need the string to be valid HTML for everything to work, which can be quite tedious to build

Modifying styling
Aside from the text or HTML of an element, it’s very common that you’ll want to change the inline style for an element.

You can access any inline CSS properties on an element using the style property

<h1 style="color: black; background-color: red;">
  Hello everyone!
</h1>
const mainHeading = document.querySelector("h1")

mainHeading.style.color // "black"
To change the style, simply reassign the value of the CSS property

const mainHeading = document.querySelector("h1")

mainHeading.style.color = "red"
How about background color?
Let’s go and change the background-color CSS property:

const mainHeading = document.querySelector("h1")

mainHeading.style.background-color // Error!
Make sure to camelCase!

mainHeading.style.backgroundColor = "green"
Modifying Attributes
So far you’ve seen how to modify HTML and text.

The third most common thing you’ll be modifying are attributes for an element

To do that, we can get attributes using getAttribute and modify attributes using setAttribute

Attributes
As a quick refresher, attributes are part of every HTML element that modify an HTML element.

An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality.

src
href
class
id
type
value
getAttribute
In order to access an attribute on an element, you can use the getAttribute method

const firstInput = document.querySelector("input")

firstInput.getAttribute("type") // "text"
setAttribute
To set an attribute on an element, you can use the setAttribute method

const firstInput = document.querySelector("input")

firstInput.setAttribute("type", "email") // "text"
Direct attribute access
There are a few attributes that you can directly access and modify as well instead of having to use getAttribute or setAttribute.

One of those is id

<input type="text" id="first-name">
const firstInput = document.querySelector("input")

firstInput.id // "first-name"

firstInput.id = "full-name" // changes the attribute
A more common one you will use is the value attribute with forms in HTML

<input type="text">
const firstInput = document.querySelector("input")

firstInput.value // ""

firstInput.value = "Just added some value!" // changes the attribute
Manipulating classes
We have quite a few ways to manipulate the class attribute in JavaScript:

setAttribute(“class”) - this will override the class
className - this will give you a string representation of the class
classList - this will give you an array-like object to add, remove or toggle classes
setAttribute(“class”)
If you want to access the class attribute you can use getAttribute(“class”) or the className property.

const mainHeading = document.querySelector("h1")

mainHeading.setAttribute("class", "section-heading");
this works, but will overwrites the previous class

className
You can also add a class by reassigning the className property

const mainHeading = document.querySelector("h1")

mainHeading.className += " top-heading" // works, but is prone to bugs
classList
An easier way to interact with classes on an element is to use the .classList method

const mainHeading = document.querySelector("h1")

mainHeading.classList // []

mainHeading.classList.add("top-heading") // ["top-heading"]

mainHeading.classList.remove("top-heading") // []

mainHeading.classList.toggle("top-heading") // true

mainHeading.classList.contains("top-heading") // true
Changing Multiple Elements
Now that you’ve seen how to modify styles, attributes, and text. How can we modify multiple elements at once?

const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");

// let's change them all to green!

listItems.style.color = "green"
//  TypeError: Cannot set property 'color' of undefined
How it’s done
To do this we need to loop over multiple elements!

const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");

for(let listItem of listItems){
  listItem.style.color = "red";
}
Working with the Dom
Creating Elements
To create an HTML element, we can use the createElement function and pass in the name of the element

This just makes an empty element, so if we want to add any text, attributes or styling we will have to do that on another line

const newButton = document.createElement("button");

const newUnorderedList = document.createElement("ul");

const newDiv = document.createElement("div");

newDiv.innerText = "a brand new div!"

newDiv.style.color = "tomato"
Appending Elements
After you create an element, you need to place it in the DOM to see it. You can do this using the append method.

append is a method that a parent element calls and you pass in the child element that you would like to place inside of the parent element

const ul = document.querySelector("ul");

const newLi = document.createElement("li");

newLi.innerText = "Hello!";

ul.append(newLi);
append will place the element as the last child in the parent. If you would like the element to be the first child, you can use the prepend method.

Removing Elements
If we want to remove elements in the DOM, we can use the handy remove method.

In order to remove an element, we first need to find it.

const ul = document.querySelector("ul");

ul.remove();
This function can only be called on a single element, so if you need to remove multiple elements you’ll need to call remove multiple times.

Finding elements near another element
As you start adding and removing elements in the DOM, there are times where you might want to know not only information about an element, but it’s parents or children.

You might want to:

find an element and remove some or all of its children
find an element and add an element to one of its children
Thankfully there are some very helpful methods for doing just that!

Setting the stage with some HTML
demo/traversal-methods/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <section>
    <h1>Here is a main heading!</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Here is a paragraph inside a div!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First list item in a div</li>
        <li>Second list item in a div</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>Here is the second div!</div>
  </section>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
Take a look at some parent, child, and sibling element relationships.

We will be focusing specifically on the <div> element.

Accessing a parent element
If you want to access the parent element of another element, you can use the parentElement method.

const foundDiv = document.querySelector("div")

foundDiv.parentElement // <section></section>
Accessing the children of an element
If you want to access the child elements of another element, you can use the children method.

foundDiv.children // HTMLCollection(2) [p, ul]
foundDiv.firstElementChild // <p>Here is a paragraph inside a div!</p>
foundDiv.lastElementChild // <ul></ul>
Accessing the siblings of an element
If you want to access the previous sibling or next sibling element of another element, you can use the previousElementSibling or nextElementSibling method.

foundDiv.previousElementSibling // <h1>Here is a main heading!</h1>
foundDiv.nextElementSibling // <div>Here is the second div!</div>
Text Nodes
You may come across other methods for finding things in the DOM, we have shown you the most common ones, but as you learn more you may come across something called a text node

Nodes Vs. Elements
With some of these finder methods, you will see that you don’t always get back an HTML element, you sometimes get back what is called a text node

Everything in the DOM is a node, some nodes are not actually HTML elements, but text or even comments!

With most of the common traversal methods, you will not need to worry about text nodes,

You will be using other methods less frequently, but know that they exist if you need to see elements near/above/below the element you find.

Recap
The DOM allows us to use JavaScript to find and modify elements and their attributes
We can modify text, styles and much more using the DOM
To easily modify multiple elements, we can iterate over a list of elements and change each one
